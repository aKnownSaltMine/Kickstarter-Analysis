# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Campaign analysis for Plays in US
Through using the kickstarter data, it is clear that one of the most attempted Kickstarter campaigns is through theater, and even further plays. Out of all 3038 US based campaigns considered, around 30% of of them were based in the realm of theater, and 73.5% of those were campaigns to fund plays. These plays were funded at around a 61% success rate.

Now upon examinging the outcomes of said campaigns based on time of year launched, it is clear that the best time to launch a campaign is in June with the data showing a spike in successful campaigns that tapers off for the rest of the year.

Some things to take into consideration about the funding goals of $10,000. This goal would place you at the upper end of goals that have succeeded in funding with it approaching almost twice the mean of successful campaigns, landing closer to the mean of failed campaigns.
Because of this, you should consider lowering the campaign goal in order to increase the chances of a successful funding campaign. 

## Campaign Analysis for Musicals in GB
For your possible future campaign to fund a musical in GB, your proposed budget of £4,000 would place it at the mean of funding, however the mean is skewed due to an outlier. Most of the funding for musicals lands below the £4,000 mark. So if it is possible, I would recommend attempting to fund your musical for under that amount.
